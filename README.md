# odin-recipes

Hello everyone,
This is a very basic website demonstrating my use and understanding of different html tags.
I have also added some very basic styling to the page.

The website itself consists of a few pages that contain different recipes.

while woring on the website, I learned:

- Many different html tags and how they work together to form a webpage
- Block and inline elements and their differences
- Basic styling such as changing colors and fonts
- How to use git for taking "snapshots" of my code
- File structure with proper naming conventions
  - index.html
  - styles.css
- Adding navigation around my site
